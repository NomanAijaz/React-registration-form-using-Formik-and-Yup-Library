ReactJs has number of libraries that makes the developer's job easy.
Formik and Yup are two well known libraries to handle and validate forms in react. 

What is Formik?
Formik is the world's most popular open source form library for React. 
It helps in getting values in and out of form state, provide initial values, 
validate schema, form submission and many more.

What is Yup?
Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
It basically force to fill the required fields and apply conditions on them.
collectively it builds a schema by applying conditions with the help of 
its object method.

Most of the time Formik and Yup are used together the schema build by Yup is used in 
Formik in validationSchema property to validate the form fields.

With the help of Formik and Yup libraries, I have developed a form in Reactjs using 
bootstrap. I have upoaded this Application at my Github account you may visit it.
